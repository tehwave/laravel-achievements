![Build Status](https://github.com/tehwave/laravel-achievements/workflows/tests/badge.svg)

## Requirements

The package has been developed and tested to work with the latest versions of PHP and Laravel as well as the following minimum requirements:

- Laravel 5.8
- PHP 7.1


## Installation

Install the package via Composer.

```bash
composer require tehwave/laravel-achievements
```

Publish migrations.

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="achievements-migrations"
```

Migrate the migrations.

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

As an optional choice, you may publish config as well.

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="achievements-config"
```

## Usage

`Laravel Achievements` work much like Laravel's [notifications](https://laravel.com/docs/notifications).

```php
$user = \App\User::find(1);

$user->achieve(new \App\Achievements\UsersFirstPost());
```

### Creating Achievements

```bash
php artisan make:achievement UsersFirstPost
```

This command will place a fresh `Achievement` class in your new `app/Achievements` directory.

Each `Achievement` class contains a `toDatabase` method, that you may use to store additional data with the achievement, and a few properties for basic meta information.

### Unlocking Achievements

Use `Achiever` trait on models that can unlock achievements.

```php
<?php

namespace App;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use tehwave\Achievements\Traits\Achiever;

class User extends Model
{
    use Achiever;

    // ...
}
```

*Achieve* an achievement via the `achieve` method.

```php
$user = \App\User::find(1);

$user->achieve(new \App\Achievements\UsersFirstPost());
```

...or use `Achievement` class to unlock achievements.

```php
$user = \App\User::find(1);

\tehwave\Achievements\Achievement::unlock($user, new \App\Achievements\UsersFirstPost());
```

### Accessing Achievements

Retrieve all of the entity's unlocked achievements.

```php
$user = \App\User::find(1);

$user->achievements()->get();
```

### Checking if entity has Achievement

On models with the `Achiever` trait, you may pass an `Achievement` instance to `hasAchievement` method to check if the specified achievement exist on the model.

```php
$achievement = new \App\Achievements\UsersFirstPost();

$user = \App\User::find(1);

$user->hasAchievement($achievement);
// false

$user->achieve($achievement);

$user->hasAchievement($achievement);
// true
```

Should you not want to pass an instance, you may also pass the class name.

```php
$user->hasAchievement(\App\Achievements\UsersFirstPost::class);
```

## Tests

```bash
composer test
```
